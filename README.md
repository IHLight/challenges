# Xpring Challenges

Xpring Challenges are interesting open source hackathon projects that we challenge the community to build. 

You can view a list of Challenges, and the hackathons that they correlate to, in the issues tab above.

# Overview

Xpring is Rippleâ€™s open developer platform for money.

Originally launched as the venture arm of Ripple, Xpring has evolved into a developer platform based on conversations with entreprenuers that we invested in, who needed access to better tools and hosted services in order to be successful.

Xpring is default open, meaning we believe in open source software, open networks and open protocols. We lead with what we build, we eat our own dog food and we ship software early and often. We like to give developers a choice on how to solve problems by making tools easy, secure and stable to use.

# How to Submit Your Project

## Step 1
Clone this repo to your desktop.

## Step 2
Create a branch named after your project.

## Step 3
In the repo, there is one folder for each Challenge. 

Open the folder that corresponds with the Challenge you are submitting against, and, in that folder, create a new subfolder.

## Step 4
Name the subfolder your project name.

## Step 5
Submit the following in your project's folder:

* Submission.md template
* A single file that pitches the product (video, PDF, deck)
* All supporting material (code, research, designs etc)
* All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.

As a reminder, we are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world. Your application should communicate this. The more compelling the presentation, the better your team does!

## Step 6
Fill out the submission.md template, included at the top of the Challenge's folder with all relevant information.

This must be included to be considered for the bounty prize.

## Step 7
Create a pull request with your team's folder submission to be merged into Master. Submit it to the repo.

## Step 8
Congratulations!

You've submitted your project to Xpring Challenges! 

We look forward to reviewing what you've been building.
